# OctoFit Tracker — Frontend

This folder will contain the React frontend for OctoFit Tracker.

Initial steps:

1. Create the folder `octofit-tracker/frontend`.
2. Initialize a front-end project (e.g., `create-react-app` or Vite) inside the folder when ready.

No packages are added here yet — this is placeholder scaffolding.
